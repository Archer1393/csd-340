<h2> Chapter 9.3: HTML & CSS featuring span tags</h2>

	<p> Matthew is a character born in <span id = "Centerville"> ___________ </span>, Iowa and raised from his parents Joanna Davis,
		and Dustin Archer until he was 3 1/2 years old. While growing up in Iowa he had a fantastic and
		prosperous life. He and his brother Michael made many friends and had all of his family surrounding
		them in various towns throughout <span id = "Iowa"> ____ </span>. Once he reached that age he moved to Las Vegas,
		Nevada with his mother Joanna to move in with his Grandmother Kitty Davis. </p>

		<hr>

		Once Matthew and his family landed in <span id = "Las Vegas"> _________ </span> they began to adapt to the bigger city lifestyle.
		There are so many opportunites, people to meet, jobs to acquire (for his mother), schools to choose
		from, and activities to attend to. Once they chose from this list, they began their journey as regular
		people in the desert, believe it or not.

		<hr>

		Many years down the road, Matthew has come to the end of his High School career. He graduates with an
		average GPA, takes 2 years off of school, then finally enrolls in the University of Nevada Las Vegas.
		Here he attends class as a photography major but then soon realizes that he needs to change to something
		more lucerative and something that he loves more: Computer Science.	He changes his degree to Bachelor of 
		Science Computer Science. Many years later of trials and tribulations he ends up where he is now at 
		<span id = "Bellevue University of Nebraska"> _______________________________ </span>.
